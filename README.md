# LLM-Project

This is a test project that follows [Andrej Karpathy's GPT2 repreduction video](https://youtu.be/l8pRSuU81PU?si=2XtORh4Xk4NP2r4H) lesson with some changes.
It uses a small portion of [fineweb-edu](https://huggingface.co/datasets/HuggingFaceFW/fineweb-edu) dataset `600M tokens (100M validation)` with RTX 4090 Laptop GPU (16GB).<br>
Main purpose for this project is to make a series of internal company sessions about LLMs and their implementation details.<br>
The `Transformers` folder contains different implementations and fine-tuning section will be added there.<br>
